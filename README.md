 ### FAQ:
 - **Does it work with device X?**
   It works only with S8 & S8+.
 - **Dual Speakers?**
   I personally don't like the dual speakers mod, but if you want you can add it [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s8/themes/stereo-sound-output-mod-s8-s8-root-t3604613)
 - **I got a bootloop!**
   If you have other sound mods installed, you'll need to install Audio Modification Library module!
